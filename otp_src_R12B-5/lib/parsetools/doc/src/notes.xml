      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>The size of the code generated by yecc has been
	    reduced. </p>
	    <p>A note regarding the <c>includefile</c> option:
	    although yecc can cope with includefiles based on some
	    earlier <c>yeccpre.hrl</c> it is recommended for
	    efficiency reasons to update includefiles as to follow
	    the pattern in the latest <c>yeccpre.hrl</c>.</p>

    <title>Parsetools 1.4</title>

    <section>
      <title>Improvements and Fixed Bugs</title>
      <p>Several modifications of Yecc have been made:</p>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>The new functions <c>file/1,2</c> take the
            role of the old functions <c>yecc/2,3,4</c>. The
            latter functions are no longer documented but are
            kept for backward compatibility.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>More checks of the grammar file have been 
            implemented. Examples are warnings for unused 
            non-terminals and duplicated declarations.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Invalid pseudo variables are no longer 
            replaced by <c>'$undefined'</c> but cause a failure.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Reserved words no longer need to be quoted
            when used as terminals or non-terminals.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>When compiling the generated parser file errors
            and warnings concerning user code refer to 
            the grammar file, not the parser file.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Yecc emits a warning if there are conflicts
            in the grammar. The new declaration <c>Expect</c> can
            be used to suppress this warning.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>The new operator precedence declaration
            <c>Nonassoc</c> can be used to declare operators with
            no associativity.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>Precedence can be given to more than one operator
            with one single operator precedence declaration.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>The function <c>parse_and_scan/1</c> in the
            default includefile accepts <c>{Function, A}</c>
            as well as {{M,F}, A} as tokenizer function.
            Exceptions in the tokenizer are never caught.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>The functions <c>yecc:file/1,2</c> can be accessed
            from the Erlang shell via the new functions <c>c:y/1,2</c> 
            in STDLIB.</p>
        </item>
      </list>
      <p>See yecc(3) for further details.</p>

          <p>A bug in <c>Yecc</c> that was introduced in R9B has been

      <title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>A bug in the file <c>parsetools/include/yeccpre.hrl</c>
            caused <c>yecc:parse_and_scan/1</c> to always report a
            parse failure when the lexer reported end-of-file. This
            problem has been fixed.</p>
