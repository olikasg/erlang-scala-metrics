    <p>The Parse Tools Application (<em>PARSETOOLS</em>) contains
      utilities for parsing, e.g. the <c>yecc</c> module. Yecc is an
      <term id="LALR-1"></term>parser generator for Erlang, similar to
      yacc. Yecc takes a <term id="BNF"></term>grammar definition as input,
      and produces Erlang code for a parser as output.</p>
    <p>There are also release notes for
      <seealso marker="notes_history">older versions</seealso>.</p>
