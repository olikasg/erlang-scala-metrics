	    <p>Memory management improvements especially for the
	    runtime system with SMP support:</p> <list> <item> The
	    runtime system with SMP support can now use multiple,
	    thread specific instances of most memory allocators. This
	    improves performance since it reduces lock contention in
	    the memory allocators. It may however increase memory
	    usage for some applications. The runtime system with SMP
	    support will by default enable this feature on most
	    allocators. The amount of instances used can be
	    configured. </item> <item> <c>driver_alloc()</c>,
	    <c>driver_realloc()</c>, and <c>driver_free()</c> now use
	    their own erts specific memory allocator instead of the
	    default <c>malloc()</c> implementation on the system.
	    </item> <item> The default configuration of some
	    allocators have been changed to fit applications that use
	    much memory better. </item> <item> Some new
	    <c>erts_alloc</c> configuration parameters have been
	    added. </item> <item> <c>erts_alloc_config</c> has been
	    modified to be able to create configurations suitable for
	    multiple instances of allocators. </item> <item> The
	    returned value from <c>erlang:system_info({allocator,
	    Alloc})</c> has been changed. This since an allocator may
	    now run in multiple instances. </item> </list> <p>If you
	    for some reason want the memory allocators to be
	    configured as before, you can pass the <c>+Mea r11b</c>
	    command-line argument to <c>erl</c>.</p> <p>For more
	    information see the <c>erts_alloc(3)</c>, the
	    <c>erts_alloc_config(3)</c>, and the <c>erlang(3)</c>
	    documentation.</p>

	    <c>dbg</c> could leave traced processes in a suspended

          <p>
	    <c>erlang:suspend_process/2</c> has been introduced which
	    accepts an option list as second argument. For more
	    information see the <c>erlang(3)</c> documentation.</p>
          <p>
	    Processes suspended via
	    <c>erlang:suspend_process/[1,2]</c> will now be
	    automatically resumed if the process that called
	    <c>erlang:suspend_process/[1,2]</c> terminates.</p>
          <p>
	    Processes could previously be suspended by one process
	    and resumed by another unless someone was tracing the
	    suspendee. This is <em>not</em> possible anymore. The
	    process resuming a process <em>has</em> to be the one
	    that suspended it.</p>

    <section><title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
            In this release the following has been fixed and
            enhanced: Autostart: It is now possible to configure
            modules that shall be loaded by the autostart mechanism.
            This because it is not certain that all application
            systems make use of the OTP boot script to set up paths
            to all Erlang modules. Runtime_tools/Inviso: A bug in the
            fetch_log functionality has been fixed. Further a bug
            that was (supposedly) fixed in a previous patch
            concerning meta-tracer write_ti has been fixed (again) in
            this patch. A bug in inviso_as_lib making remote
            autostart config file updates fail has been fixed.
            Inviso: inviso_tool has been given a flush API.</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
          <p>
            The following bugs/improvements have been done: Internal
            interworking between inviso_rt and inviso_rt_meta. The
            call function used by inviso_rt to call inviso_rt_meta is
            now protected with a monitor. Inviso_rt_meta now includes
            the timestamp of the incoming meta trace message when
            calling the call-callback. (Makes it possible to add a
            "better" timestamp to the ti-file.) Bug in inviso_tool
            making it not remove trace patterns when terminating. Bug
            in internal function h_start_session making inviso_tool
            crash if there were no active nodes to start the session
            on. The user-inviso_tool and inviso API-inviso control
            component request/response gen_server protocols had
            default time-out. Since many trace operations can be time
            consuming, a longer time-out is necessary. Improved
            overload protection. It is now possible to let the
            overload protection renew itself (e.g after an exit from
            an external overload protector). Inviso_rt_meta now fully
            uses the exception_trace match spec action term. Run
            Trace Case API (as in contrast to activate and deactivate
            trace case APIs) in inviso_tool. Flush trace-port API
            added to inviso. Get_session_data API added to
            inviso_tool. Improved inviso_tool:stop making it possible
            to name nodes which shall not have their trace patterns
            removed when inviso_tool terminates. Bug in handling of
            writing multiple ti-entries if returned from a
            call/return_from call-back in inviso_rt_meta Process
            trace flags are no longer explicitly removed by the
            inviso_tool when it terminates. Not necessary.
            Inviso_tool get_autostart_data adopted to standard
            autostarter.</p>

      <title>Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions</title>
      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>A bug in inviso_rt_meta caused an ETS table containing
            information on initiated (init_tpm) functions to be lost
            when suspending tracing. Further an enhancement to
            inviso_rt has been introduced making it possible to
            activate process trace flags based on globally registered
            names. It is then not an error to activate a global name
            on a node where the name does not reside. The process
            count in the return value will simply be set to zero
            (hence exactly one node in the NodeResult part of the
            return value will indicate one matching process found). A
            bug was found in fetch_log API. At the same time the
            fetch_log functionality was enhanced to also offer flow
            control making fetcher processes send chunks of
            transferred file data at a slower pace.</p>

        <item>
          <p>This ticket includes several improvements and bugfixes to
            both runtime_tools and inviso. The overload mechanism can
            now also react to incomming messages. This is useful if
            an external overload watch-dog is used. Some improvements
            of variable bindings has been done to the default
            autostart mechanism - inviso_autostart_server. Autostart
            "jobs" can now be done in paralell, allowing for some
            jobs to hang waiting for some parts of the traced system
            to become ready before proceeding. Previously when using
            named meta-match-specs (tpm_ms) ending up with zero
            match-specs still kept the meta trace pattern active.
            This caused zero match-specs to be equal to unlimited
            meta tracing on that particular function. If the internal
            database becomes empty of meta match specs, meta trace
            pattern is removed for that function. Standard public
            loop data in the inviso runtime meta tracer process is
            now extended to a 2-tuple. The functions ctp/1 and ctpl/1
            are added making it possible to remove trace patterns for
            a list of functions rather than one by one.
            Inviso_rt_meta will now accept a list of binaries to be
            output into the trace information file, in additions to a
            single binary. Further it is also possible to make own
            output to the trace information file using the write_ti/1
            function. An error was discovered in inviso_rt making the
            inviso_rt_meta remain rather than terminate if the
            inviso_rt terminated due to "running alone" (not allowed
            to run without a control component). A new tool,
            inviso_tool, has been added to the inviso application.</p>
