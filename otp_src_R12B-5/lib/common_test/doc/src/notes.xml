	    Common Test now uses the re application instead of the
	    previous rx driver to perform regular expression matching
	    on telnet strings. Since re works on all supported
	    operating systems, it is now possible to run telnet
	    sessions also on platforms such as e.g. Windows (which
	    was not the case with the previous rx driver). Note that
	    the rx driver is obsolete from now on, and will be
	    removed from Common Test after OTP R12B.</p>

	    It is now possible, by means of the new function
	    ct:abort_current_testcase/1 or
	    test_server_ctrl:abort_current_testcase/1, to abort the
	    currently executing test case.</p>

	    The configure test of the rx lib in Common Test was not
	    performed during the general OTP application
	    configuration phase. This made e.g. autoconf impossible.
	    This has been changed to correspond with the normal OTP
	    build procedure.</p>

          <p>
	    The rx library, included with common_test, failed to
	    build on on some architectures because the -fPIC compiler
	    option was missing.</p>
