  <section>
    <title>Test structure</title>

    <p>A test consists of a set of test cases. Each test case is
    implemented as an Erlang function. An Erlang module implementing
    one or more test cases is called a test suite. One or more test 
    suites are stored in a test directory.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Skipping test cases</title>

    <p>It is possible to skip certain test cases, for example if you
    know beforehand that a specific test case fails. This might be
    functionality which isn't yet implemented, a bug that is known but
    not yet fixed or some functionality which doesn't work or isn't
    applicable on a specific platform.</p>

    <p>There are several different ways to state that one or more 
    test cases should be skipped:</p>
    <list>

      <item>Using <c>skip_suites</c> and <c>skip_cases</c>
      terms in 
      <seealso marker="run_test_chapter#test_specifications">test specifications</seealso>.
      </item>

      <item>Returning <c>{skip,Reason}</c> from the
      <c>init_per_testcase/2</c> or <c>init_per_suite/1</c> functions.</item>

      <item>Returning <c>{skip,Reason}</c> from the execution clause
      of the test case.</item>

    </list>

    <p>The latter of course means that the execution clause is
    actually called, so the author must make sure that the test case
    is not run.</p>

    <p>When a test case is skipped, it will be noted as <c>SKIPPED</c>
    in the HTML log.</p>

    <title>Definition of terms</title>
    
    <taglist>
      
      <tag><em>data_dir</em></tag>
      <item>
	Data directory for a test suite. This directory contains
	any files used by the test suite, e.g. additional Erlang
	modules, binaries or data files.
      </item>
      
      <tag><em>major log file</em></tag>
      <item>
	An overview log file for one or more test suites.
      </item>

      <tag><em>minor log file</em></tag>
      <item>
	A log file for one particular test case.
      </item>
      <tag><em>priv_dir</em></tag>
      <item>
	Private directory for a test suite. This directory should
	be used when the test suite needs to write to files.
      </item>

      <tag><em>test case</em></tag>
      <item>
	A single test included in a test suite. A test case is
	implemented as a function in a test suite module.
      </item>
      
      <tag><em>test suite</em></tag>
      <item>
	An erlang module containing a collection of test cases for
	a specific functional area.
      </item>

      <tag><em>test directory</em></tag>
      <item>
	A directory that contains one or more test suite modules, i.e.
	a group of test suites.
      </item>
