    <title>General</title>

    <p>The Common Test framework uses configuration files to
    describe data related to a test or a test plant. The configuration
    data makes it possible to change properties without changing the
    test program itself. Configuration data can for example be:</p>

    <list>
      <item>Addresses to the test plant or other instruments</item>
      <item>Filenames for files needed by the test</item>
      <item>Program names for programs that shall be run by the test</item>
      <item>Any other variable that is needed by the test</item>
    </list>

  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Syntax</title>

    <p>A config file can contain any number of elements of the type:</p>
    <pre>
      {Key,Value}.</pre>

    <p>where</p>
    <pre>
      Key = atom()
      Value = term() | [{Key,Value}]</pre>

    <title>Reading config values</title>

    <p>From inside a test suite, one can <em>require</em> a variable
    to exist before a test case can be run, and <em>read</em> the
    value of a variable.</p>

    <p><c>require</c> is a statement that can be part of the <seealso
    marker="write_test_chapter#suite">test suite default
    data</seealso> or
    <seealso marker="write_test_chapter#info_function">test case info
    function</seealso>. If the required variable is not available, the
    test is skipped. There is also a function
    <c>ct:require/[1,2]</c> which can be called from inside a
    test suite in order to check if a specific variable is
    available. The return value from the function must then be checked
    and appropriate actions taken explicitly by the test case.</p>

    <p>A <c>require</c> statement should look like this:
    <c>{require,Required}</c> or <c>{require,Name,Required}</c>. The
    arguments <c>Name</c> and <c>Required</c> are the same as the
    arguments to <c>ct:require/[1,2]</c> which are described in the
    reference manual for <seealso marker="ct">ct</seealso>.</p>

    <p>To read the value of a config variable, use the function
    <c>get_config/[1,2]</c> which is also described in the reference
    manual for <seealso marker="ct">ct</seealso>.</p>

    <title>Examples</title>

    <p>A config file for usning telnet to communicate with
      a unix host could look like this:</p>

    <pre>
    {unix,[{telnet,"durin.du.uab"},
           {username,"someuser"},
	   {password,"somepassword"}]}.</pre>
