    <p>The <c><![CDATA[erl_interface]]></c> library is a <c><![CDATA[C]]></c> interface library
      for communication with <c><![CDATA[Erlang]]></c>.</p>
    <note>
      <p>By default, the <c><![CDATA[erl_interface]]></c> library is only guaranteed
        to be compatible with other Erlang/OTP components from the same
        release as the <c><![CDATA[erl_interface]]></c> library. See the documentation
        of the
        <seealso marker="erl_eterm#erl_set_compat_rel">erl_set_compat_rel()</seealso>
        function on how to communicate with Erlang/OTP components from earlier
        releases.</p>
