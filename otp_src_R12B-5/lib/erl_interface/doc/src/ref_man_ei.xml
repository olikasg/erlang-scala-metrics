    <p>The <c><![CDATA[ei]]></c> library is a <c><![CDATA[C]]></c> interface library for
      communication with <c><![CDATA[Erlang]]></c>.</p>
    <note>
      <p>By default, the <c><![CDATA[ei]]></c> library is only guaranteed
        to be compatible with other Erlang/OTP components from the same
        release as the <c><![CDATA[ei]]></c> library itself. See the documentation of the
        <seealso marker="ei#ei_set_compat_rel">ei_set_compat_rel()</seealso>
        function on how to communicate with Erlang/OTP components from earlier
        releases.</p>
