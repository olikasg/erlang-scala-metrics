	  <p><c>timer</c> module now uses gen_server:call/3 with timeout set 
	    to infinity instead of the default value 5 sec.
	  <p> Own Id: OTP-1688

	<item> 
	  <p><c>sys:log_to_file</c> didn't close old log files if they
	    were not explicitly closed.

      <title>Improvements and new features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	  <p>A new function <c>filename:nativename(Path)</c> which
	  normalizes and converts a filename string to a
	  representation accepted by the command shell and native
	  applications on the current platform. On Windows forward
	  slashes are converted to back slashes.

	  <p>Own Id:OTP-1632

	<item>
	  <p>The <c>calendar</c> module has been updated with a set of
	  new functions for conversion between local and universal time,
	  and for computing differencies between epochs in time, and
	  for converting return values from <c>erlang:now()</c> to
	  local and universal time.

    <section>
      <title>Incompatibilities with Stdlib 1.3.2</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>Due to the new semantics in the <c>!</c> operator, the
	    generic behaviour functions that previously could exit,
	    cannot exit anymore.  For example, <c>gen_server:call</c>
	    do not exit if the server does not exist.  It still exits
	    if no answer is received within the timeout.

    <section>
      <title>Incompatibilities with Stdlib 1.3.1</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>Because of the major updates to the <c>slave</c> module a
	    version of OTP with this new slave module as described
	    here *cannot* start slave nodes on computers using an
	    older version of OTP, and vice versa.

	    <p>The return values from <c>slave</c> on error are
	    changed (atoms are used instead of strings).

      <list>
	<item>
	  <p><c>filename:basename("/foo/bar/")</c> returned wrong
	  result: <c>[]</c>. The last <c>/</c> should be ignored and
	  the result should be <c>"bar"</c>.

      <section>
	<title>Improvements and new features</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p><c>slave:start</c> is enhanced to work on other platforms
	    (e.g WIN32). Previously it was UNIX specific.

	  <p>Own Id:OTP-1463
	<item>
	  <p>The <c>timer</c> module is modified to be a gen_server
	    and is now supervised by the safe kernel supervisor.

	  <p><c>ets</c> tables created before the system was converted to a
	    distributed system could not be accessed then the system
	    became distributed. The representation of the <c>ets</c> table
	    identifier is thus changed.
