	  <p>Because of the major updates to the <c>slave</c> module a
	    version of OTP with this new slave module as described
	    here *cannot* start slave nodes on computers using an
	    older version of OTP, and vice versa.

	    <p>The return values from <c>slave</c> on error are
	    changed (atoms are used instead of strings).

	  <item>
	    <p>Corrected spelling errors in <c>help()</c> printout from shell.
	    <p>Own Id: OTP-1038
	  </item>

	<item><p>Added a new function <c>sync_notify</c> in <c>gen_event</c>.
	    <p>Own Id: OTP-1310

	<item>
	  <p>The functions <c>add_sup_handler/3</c> and
	    <c>swap_sup_handler/3</c> are added to the
	    <c>gen_event</c> module.  They are used to supervise
	    <c>gen_event</c> handlers.

	    <p>Own Id: OTP-1122
	</item>

	<item>
	  <p>It is possible to add several handlers using the same call-back
	    module to a <c>gen_event</c> event manager. Use the new
	    <c>{Module, Id}</c> syntax for such event handlers.
	</item>

	<item>
	  <p><c>gen_event</c> generates an error report when a handler
	    crashes.
	</item>

	<item><p>Two new supervisor types <c>rest_for_one</c> and
	  <c>simple_one_for_one</c> are added.
	  <p>Own Id: OTP-1177
	</item>

	<item><p><c>os:type/1</c> and its documentation is corrected. 
	  <p>Own Id: OTP-1185

	  <p>The function <c>init_ack/1</c> is added to the <c>proc_lib</c>
	    module.
	</item>

	<item>
	  <p><c>erl_lint</c> produces warnings related to the <c>behaviour</c>
	    module attribute. For example, missing call-back functions are
	    reported. This feature is used by the compiler.

    <title>Stdlib 1.2</title>

    <section>
      <title>Improvements and new features</title>
      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>The <c>dets</c> module has been greatly enhanced. Previously
	    the <c>dets</c> module had no real space management on the file.
	    Now, space is managed on a per file basis by a builtin buddy system.
	    This means that allocation is much faster. The format of a dets file
	    is consequently also changed, the dets module will however 
	    recognize files with the old format and automatically upgrade
	    the file to the new format the first time it is opened.
	  <p>This has consequences for the Mnesia system, or rather it does not,
	    since the version upgrade is done automatically.
	<item>
	<p>A new module <c>filename</c> which has a number of useful functions 
		for manipulation of filenames. These functions are recommended
		to use
		when writing applications which shall be runnable on a number
	of different platforms.
	<item>
	<p>A new module <c>os</c> which provides functions which enables
	various information from the host operating system to the Erlang 
	programmer. The function <c>cmd/1</c> is equivalent with the 
	<c>unix:cmd/1</c> on a unix platform and will also be available
	on other platforms if applicable, e.g on Windows NT. This function
	is the recommended way of issuing operating system commands from
	Erlang programs (rather than <c>unix:cmd/1</c>). Other functions
	in the module are <c>version</c> and <c>type></c> which give
	information about the host operating system version and type.

	  <p>The <c>ets</c> man page updated (Name instead of Id).
	  <p>Own Id: OTP-1001.
	<item>
	  <p>The <c>ets</c> module now handles arbitrarily many variables.
	    Previously there was an upper limit of 10.
	  <p>Own Id: OTP-1124.

	  <p>Added <c>proc_lib:start/3,4</c>,
	  <c>proc_lib:start_link/3,4</c> and
	  <c>proc_lib:init_ack/2</c> for synchronous start of
	  <c>proc_lib</c> processes.

	<item>
	  <p>Fixed bug in <c>timer</c> there timeouts would cause an internal
	    error under heavy load.
      </list>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Incompatibilities with OTP P1G</title>

      <list>
	<item>
	  <p>It is possible to change the internal state of the event manager
	    using the <c>gen_event:call</c> function. The <c>handle_call/2</c>
	    call-back function should return in a similar way as the
	    <c>handle_event/2</c> function.

	<item>
	  <p>A <c>gen_event</c> worker should specify <c>dynamic</c> for
	    modules in the supervisor child specification.
