	    When a testcase terminated due to a timetrap, io sent to
	    the group leader from framework:end_tc/3 (using
	    ct:pal/2/3 or ct:log/2/3) would cause deadlock. This has
	    been fixed.</p>

	    Test Server is a portable test server for automated
	    application testing. The server can run test suites on
	    local or remote targets and log progress and results to
	    HTML pages. The main purpose of Test Server is to act as
	    engine inside customized test tools. A callback interface
	    for such framework applications is provided.</p>
