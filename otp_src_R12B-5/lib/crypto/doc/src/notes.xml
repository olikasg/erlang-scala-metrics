          <p>The linked in driver for the crypto application is now
            linked statically against the OpenSSL libraries, to avoid
            installation and runtime problems in connection to the
            OpenSSL library locations.</p>

        <item>
          <p>The previously undocumented and UNSUPPORTED <c>ssh</c>
            application has been updated and documented. This release
            of the <c>ssh</c> application is still considered to be a
            beta release and (if necessary) there could still be
            changes in its API before it reaches 1.0.</p>
          <p>Also, more cryptographic algorithms have been added to
            the <c>crypto</c> application.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Linked in drivers in the crypto, and asn1 applications
            are now compiled with the -D_THREAD_SAFE and -D_REENTRANT
            switches on unix when the emulator has thread support
            enabled.</p>
          <p>Linked in drivers on MacOSX are not compiled with the
            undocumented -lbundle1.o switch anymore. Thanks to Sean
            Hinde who sent us a patch.</p>
          <p>Linked in driver in crypto, and port programs in ssl, now
            compiles on OSF1.</p>
          <p>Minor makefile improvements in runtime_tools.</p>

        <item>
          <p>Corrected error handling. If the port to the driver that
            crypto uses is unexpectedly closed (which should not
            happen during normal operation of crypto), crypto will
            terminate immediately (rather than crashing the next time
            crypto is used). Also corrected build problems on Mac OS
            X.</p>

        <item>
          <p>It was not possible in R9 to relink the crypto driver.
            The object file was missing as well as an example
            makefile. The crypto driver object file is now released
            with the application (installed in priv/obj). An example
            makefile has also been added to the priv/obj directory.
            The makefile serves as an example of how to relink the
            driver on Unix (crypto_drv.so) or Windows
            (crypto_drv.dll).</p>

      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>
          <p>Previous versions of Crypto where delivered with
            statically linked binaries based on SSLeay. That is not
            longer the case.  The current version of Crypto requires
            dynamically linked OpenSSL libraries that the user has to
            install. The library needed is <c>libcrypto.so</c> (Unix)
            or <c>libeay32.[lib|dll]</c> (Win32). For further details
            see the crypto(6) application manual page.</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>This version of Crypto uses the new DES interface of
            OpenSSL 0.9.7, which is not backward compatible with
            earlier versions of OpenSSL.
            </p>
        </item>
        <item>The functions <c>des_ede3_cbc_encrypt/5</c> and
        <c>des_ede3_cbc_decrypt/5</c> have been renamed to
        <c>des3_cbc_encrypt/5</c> and <c>des3_cbc_decrypt/5</c>,
         respectively. The old functions have been retained (they are
         deprecated and not listed in the crypto(3) manual page).</item>

      <list type="bulleted">
        <item>To obtain backward compatibility with the old SSLeay
         package, and with earlier versions of OpenSSL, the macro
         OPENSSL_DES_LIBDES_COMPATIBILITY has been added to
        <c>crypto_drv.c</c>. This is of importance only for the open
         source version of Crypto.
