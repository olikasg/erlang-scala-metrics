        <item>
          <p>The stub/skeleton-files generated by IC have been improved,
            i.e., depending on the IDL-files, reduced the size of the
            erl- and beam-files and decreased dependencies off Orber's
            Interface Repository. It is necessary to re-compile all IDL-files
            and use COS-applications, including Orber, compiled with
            IC-4.2.</p>

          <p>First release of the cosFileTransfer application. Please note that
            the OMG specification was not finalized when this version
            was released. Hence, the API may be changed in way which is not
            compatible with this version. Contact support if you are in doubt.</p>
