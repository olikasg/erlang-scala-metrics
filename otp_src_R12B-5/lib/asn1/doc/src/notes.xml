            A bug, related to instatiation of a parameterized type
            with a type definition in the parameterlist, has been
            removed. The defininition of the parameter type was in
            another module than the instance definition causing
            limited module info.</p>

            A corrupted encoding may cause a loop when a buffer of at
            least two bytes of zero matches tag and length of a SET
            component. This behaviour occured only with decoder
            generated with <c>ber</c> or <c>ber_bin</c> optionsNow a
            control breaks the loop.</p>

          <p>
            The precedence rules for extended constraints have been
            misinterpreted. The rule says for instance that if there
            are more than one constraint on a type that have
            extensionmark, only the last of the extensionmarks would
            be kept. This affects the encoding of PER and is now
            corrected.</p>

            A constrained number with a singlevalue constraint that

          <p>When copiling an asn1 source that reference a type in
            another source the compiler uses the asn1db file of the
            other source to resolve the reference. It also tests
            whether the other source has been updated since the
            asn1db file was generated. This last test was to brutal
            in that it exits compilation when no source was found,
            even though a asn1db file existed. Changed behaviour from
            a brutal exit to a warning.</p>
