	    The listen socket used for the distributed Erlang
	    protocol now uses the socket option 'reuseaddr', which is
	    useful when you force the listen port number using kernel
	    options 'inet_dist_listen_min' and 'inet_dist_listen_max'
	    and restarts a node with open connections.</p>

	    Fixed memory leak of unclosed TCP-ports. A gen_tcp:send()
	    followed by a failing gen_tcp:recv() could in some cases
	    cause the port to linger after being closed.</p>

	    <p>Processes spawned using <c>proc_lib</c> (including
	    <c>gen_server</c> and other library modules that use
	    <c>proc_lib</c>) no longer keep the entire argument list
	    for the initial call, but only the arity.</p>
	    <p>Also, if <c>proc_lib:spawn/1</c> is used to spawn a
	    fun, the actual fun is not kept, but only module,
	    function name, and arity of the function that implements
	    the fun.</p>
	    <p>The reason for the change is that keeping the initial
	    fun (or a fun in an argument list), would prevent
	    upgrading the code for the module. A secondary reason is
	    that keeping the fun and function arguments could waste a
	    significant amount of memory.</p>
	    <p>The drawback with the change is that the crash reports
	    will provide less precise information about the initial
	    call (only <c>Module:Function/Arity</c> instead of
	    <c>Module:Function(Arguments)</c>). The function
	    <c>proc_lib:initial_call/1</c> still returns a list, but
	    each argument has been replaced with a dummy atom.</p>

	    <c>io:get_line/1</c> when reading from standard input is
	    now substantially faster. There are also some minor
	    performance improvements in <c>io:get_line/1</c> when
	    reading from any file opened in binary mode. (Thanks to

	    for more info.</p>
          <p>
	    The error handling of <c>escripts</c> has been improved.</p>
          <p>
	    An <c>escript</c> may now set explicit arguments to the

          <p>
	    An <c>escript</c> may now contain a precompiled beam
	    file.</p>
          <p>
	    An <c>escript</c> may now contain an archive file
	    containing one or more applications (experimental).</p>
          <p>
	    The internal module <c>code_aux</c> has been removed.</p>

	    New BIF <c>erlang:decode_packet/3</c> that extracts a
	    protocol packet from a binary. Similar to the socket
	    option <c>{packet, Type}</c>. Also documented the socket
	    packet type <c>http</c> and made it official.
	    <em>NOTE</em>: The tuple format for <c>http</c> packets
	    sent from an active socket has been changed in an

	    In the SMP emulator, there was small risk that
	    <c>code:purge(Mod)</c> would kill a process that was
	    running code in <c>Mod</c> and unload the module
	    <c>Mod</c> before the process had terminated.
	    <c>code:purge(Mod)</c> now waits for confirmation (using

	    before proceeding.</p>

	    <p>The beta testing module <c>gen_sctp</c> now supports
	    active mode as stated in the documentation. Active mode
	    is still rather untested, and there are some issues about
	    what should be the right semantics for
	    <c>gen_sctp:connect/5</c>. In particular: should it be
	    blocking or non-blocking or choosable. There is a high

	    The documentation of the <c>processes/0</c> BIF and the

	    Posix error codes now originate from the OS file system
	    calls or are generated only for very similar causes (for
	    example 'enomem' is generated if a memory allocation
	    fails, and 'einval' is generated if the file handle in

	    a single byte using <c>file:write/2</c> instead of a list
	    or binary of one byte, contradictory to the

	    <p>The functions io:columns/0, io:columns/1, io:rows/0
	    and io:rows/1 are added to allow the user to get

	    some advantage of this when formatting output. For
	    regular files and other io-devices where height and width
	    are not applicable, the functions return
	    {error,enotsup}.</p>
	    <p>Potential incompatibility: If one has written a custom
	    io-handler, the handler has to either return an error or
	    take care of io-requests regarding terminal height and
	    width. Usually that is no problem as io-handlers, as a
	    rule of thumb, should give an error reply when receiving
	    unknown io-requests, instead of crashing.</p>

          <p>When setting the kernel configuration parameter

          <p>An interface towards the SCTP Socket API Extensions
            has been implemented.It is an Open Source patch courtesy
            of Serge Aleynikov and Leonid Timochouk. The Erlang code
            parts has been adapted by the OTP team, changing the
            Erlang API somewhat.</p>
          <p>The Erlang interface consists of the module
            <c>gen_sctp</c> and an include file
            <c>-include_lib("kernel/include/inet_sctp.hrl").</c> for
            option record definitions. The <c>gen_sctp</c> module is
            documented.</p>
          <p>The delivered Open Source patch, before the OTP team
            rewrites, was written according to
            <url href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctpsocket-13</url>
            and was claimed to work fine, tested on Linux Fedora Core
            5.0 (kernel 2.6.15-2054 or later) and on Solaris 10 and
            11. The OTP team rewrites used the same standard document
            but might have accidentally broken some functionality. If
            so, it will soon be patched to working state. The tricky
            parts in C and the general design has essentially not
            changed. During the rewrites the code was hand tested on
            SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10, and briefly on Solaris
            10. Feedbach on code and docs is very much
            appreciated.</p>
          <p>The SCTP interface is in beta state. It has only been
            hand tested and has no automatic test suites in OTP
            meaning everything is most certainly not tested. Socket
            active mode is broken. IPv6 is not tested. The documentation
            has been reworked due to the API changes,
            but has not been proofread after this.</p>
          <p>Thank you from the OTP team to Serge Aleynikov and
            Leonid Timochouk for a valuable contribution. We hope we
            have not messed it up too much.</p>

          <p>To help Dialyzer find more bugs, many functions in the
            Kernel and STDLIB applications now only accept arguments
            of the type that is documented.</p>
          <p>For instance, the functions <c>lists:prefix/2</c> and
            <c>lists:suffix/2</c> are documented to only accept lists
            as their arguments, but they actually accepted anything
            and returned <c>false</c>. That has been changed so that
            the functions cause an exception if one or both arguments
            are not lists.</p>
          <p>Also, the <c>string:strip/3</c> function is documented
            to take a character argument that is a character to strip
            from one or both ends of the string. Given a list instead
            of a character, it used to do nothing, but will now cause
            an exception.</p>
          <p>Dialyzer will find most cases where those functions
            are passed arguments of the wrong type.</p>

          <p>Previously <c>unlink/1</c> and <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c>
            behaved completely asynchronous. This had one undesirable
            effect, though. You could never know when you were
            guaranteed <em>not</em> to be affected by a link that you
            had unlinked or a monitor that you had demonitored.</p>
          <p>The new behavior of <c>unlink/1</c> and
            <c>erlang:demonitor/2</c> can be viewed as two operations
            performed atomically. Asynchronously send an unlink
            signal or a demonitor signal, and ignore any future
            results of the link or monitor.</p>
          <p><em>NOTE</em>: This change can cause some obscure code
            to fail which previously did not. For example, the
            following code might hang:</p>
          <code type="none">
\011    Mon = erlang:monitor(process, Pid),
\011    %% ...
\011    exit(Pid, bang),
\011    erlang:demonitor(Mon),
\011    receive
\011        {'DOWN', Mon, process, Pid, _} -> ok
\011    %% We were previously guaranteed to get a down message
\011    %% (since we exited the process ourself), so we could
\011    %% in this case leave out:
\011    %% after 0 -> ok
\011    end,

            accidently or by design given several names, it is

            the error logger when <c>global</c> discovers that some

            affects the node where it is defined.</p>

          <p>You can now start Erlang with the <c>-rsh</c> flag which
            gives you a remote initial shell instead of a local one.
            Example:</p>
          <pre>
\011    erl -sname this_node -rsh other_node@other_host
          </pre>
          <p>Own Id: OTP-5210</p>
        </item>
        <item>
          <p>If <c>/etc/hosts</c> specified two hosts with the same IP
            address (on separate lines), only the last host would be
            registered by inet_db during inet configuration. This has
            been corrected now so that both aliases are registered
            with the same IP address.</p>

          <p>The documentation for BIFs that take I/O lists have
            been clarified. Those are <c>list_to_binary/1</c>,
            <c>port_command/2</c>, <c>port_control/3</c>.</p>
          <p>Documentation for all <c>is_*</c> BIFs (such as
            <c>is_atom/1</c>) has been added.</p>
          <p>Removed the documentation for
            <c>erlang:float_to_binary/2</c> which was removed from
            the run-time system several releases ago.</p>
