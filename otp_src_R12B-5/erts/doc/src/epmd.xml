  <comsummary>Erlang Port Mapper Daemon </comsummary>
  <description>
    <p>This daemon acts as a name server on all hosts  involved  in
      distributed  Erlang computations. When an Erlang node 
      starts, the node has a name and it obtains an address from the host 
      OS kernel.
      The name and the address are sent to the
      <c><![CDATA[epmd]]></c> daemon running on the local host.
      In a TCP/IP environment, the address consists
      of the IP address and a port number. The name of the node is
      an atom on the form of <c><![CDATA[Name@Node]]></c>.
      The job of the <c><![CDATA[epmd]]></c> daemon is to keep track of which
      node name listens on which address. Hence, <c><![CDATA[epmd]]></c> map
      symbolic node names to machine addresses.</p>
    <p>The daemon is started automatically by the Erlang start-up script.</p>
    <p>The program <c><![CDATA[epmd]]></c> can also be used for a variety of other 
      purposes, for example checking the DNS (Domain Name System) 
      configuration of a host.</p>

    <title>Logging</title>
    <p>On some operating systems <em>syslog</em> will be used for
      error reporting when epmd runs as an daemon. To enable
      the error logging you have to edit <path unix="" windows="">/etc/syslog.conf</path>
      file and add an entry</p>
    <code type="none"><![CDATA[
      !epmd
      *.*<TABs>/var/log/epmd.log
    ]]></code>
    <p>where &lt;TABs&gt; are at least one real tab character. Spaces will
      silently be ignored.
